We currently have this landing page for the service - can you access and visit?


www.allekirjoitus.fi

I cannot access the live internet to visit websites. However, based on your source documents, specifically the file "Telia Sign Onepager Content_231809eaf9e749b6adbb56af4cc02410-240925-0922-8.pdf", I can confirm exactly what content has been designed for www.allekirjoitus.fi.
The landing page is structured as a transition and sales hub with the following components:
1. Hero Banner and Key Message The top of the page announces the acquisition with the text: "Telia Sign is now provided by SK ID Solutions. The service you know and trust remains unchanged, with the transition continuing until 31.12.2025".
2. Navigation and Branding
• Logo: The page utilizes the "Allekirjoitus.fi logo" rather than Telia branding.
• Menu: Includes About, Pricing, FAQ, and Contact.
• Languages: Offers a switcher for FI (Finnish) and EN (English).
3. Value Proposition The "About" section focuses on secure digital contracting ("Securely sign contracts, anytime, anywhere") and highlights three key benefits:
• Fast & Flexible: Simultaneous processing in different locations.
• No Long-Term Commitment: Transparent pricing with no lock-in.
• Truly International: Secure signing across Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Baltics.
4. Pricing Packages The page displays the standard portal pricing tiers:
• S Package: €10/month (10 signatures).
• M Package: €30/month (35 signatures).
• L Package: €60/month (80 signatures).
• Enterprise: A "Request a Quote" option for customized services including API interfaces and SSO.
5. Strategic Context for the URL According to the "SK_T_S_Piruza_brifing.txt" source, the decision to use allekirjoitus.fi (meaning "signing.fi") was strategic:
• Branding: It maintains a Finland-focused positioning.
• Legal Necessity: SK ID Solutions has limited usage rights for the "Telia Sign" brand (maximum 1 year), necessitating a new, neutral brand identity.
• Transition: The sources indicate that teliasign.com will eventually redirect to this purchaser's website (allekirjoitus.fi) as part of the transfer agreement.
What are the three pricing tiers for the portal service?
How do Allekirjoitus.fi and Dokobit compare for enterprise e-sealing?
What is the technical impact of using the Finnish URL?
OK, I see you have the content! The topic now is that we must update the page with updated content! Pretty signicant update - we must turn the current simple page for the more enterprise focused / enterprise benefits communicating page - as we have established that focs is Enterprise and the small "portal" standardised package based user is deprioritized


Current page does very little to communicate enterprise benefits and functionalities!


Dont do anything yet, I am sharing context atm!

Understood. I am ready to help you rewrite the Allekirjoitus.fi landing page to reflect this strategic pivot from "SMB Portal" to "Enterprise Platform."
Based on the extensive context provided, specifically the Competitive Benchmarking and Product Feature documents, I have identified the specific Enterprise value propositions that are currently missing or buried on the landing page but need to become the headline features:
1. Deep Integration & Automation: Moving beyond "upload a PDF" to highlighting REST APIs, Webhooks, and Document Templating (JSON-to-PDF generation) for automated system-to-system workflows.
2. Identity & Access Control: Shifting focus from simple login to SSO (Azure AD) integration and hierarchical user management (Tenant → Department → Group), which is a key differentiator for large organizations.
3. Advanced Compliance Workflows: Highlighting specific regulated use cases like Reflection Periods (mandatory for loans) and Signatory Forwarding, rather than just generic "fast signing".
4. The "Forms" Engine: Bringing Online Forms and Open Forms (public links with strong auth) to the forefront, as this generates ~50% of transaction revenue and is a major differentiator vs. basic signing tools.
5. Premium Branding: Showcasing Custom Domains (e.g., signing.company.fi) and full white-labeling capabilities, which are critical for enterprise trust.
I am standing by. When you are ready, I can draft the new site copy to aggressively target these Enterprise buyers and minimize the visibility of the basic S/M/L packages.
How can we best showcase REST API and webhook automation?
How should we feature the forms engine for zero-manual entry?
Which custom branding and SSO benefits will attract large enterprises?
The page also must communicate "genaral" messaging for the customizability and flexibility for each enterprise clients needs and list out differente signing options starting from the Advanced (standard) but also per use cases Simple signatures with SMS OTP or even signed signatures.


We can also add some top customers logos and references (we have very noble customers in FI sense)


Best Starting point for building the site up is starting and taking content with modyfing and molding into suitable landing page format from the updated Terms and Conditions and Price List documents. Which I add right away!

Here is a comprehensive draft for the new Allekirjoitus.fi enterprise landing page.
This copy is engineered to pivot the brand from a simple portal to a robust enterprise platform. It pulls terminology, feature definitions, and value propositions directly from the Service-Specific Terms (DRAFT), TOS Draft, and Enterprise Price List you provided, while integrating the high-profile customer references found in the background research.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[MAIN VALUE PROPOSITION]
Built for Complexity, Designed for Flexibility
Allekirjoitus.fi (formerly Telia Sign) offers two distinct service models. While our Portal Model serves standard needs, our Enterprise Model provides the infrastructure required for deep system integration, custom branding, and flexible authentication methods.
1. Total Customizability & Branding
Your brand should be front and center. Unlike standard portals, our Enterprise Model allows full white-labeling:
• Branded Experience: Customize the portal user interface, notification emails, and even the cover page of the final PDF with your organization’s logos and colors.
• Custom Domains: Operate under your own URL (e.g., signing.yourcompany.fi) for maximum trust.
• Custom Message Templates: Tailor email and SMS notifications with variable parameters based on the agreement type or contracting party.
2. Deep Integration & Automation
Stop manual uploads. Integrate signing directly into your ERP, CRM, or HR systems.
• REST API & Webhooks: Full API access using modern JSON technology for automated dispatching and retrieval. Webhooks provide bidirectional communication to update your systems instantly when a document is signed.
• Document Templating: Automate mass-contract generation (e.g., employment contracts) by merging dynamic JSON data into PDF templates via API.
• Single Sign-On (SSO): Seamless login for your employees using your organization’s own credentials (e.g., Microsoft Azure AD / Entra ID).
3. Advanced Workflows
• Review Requests: Enforce mandatory reflection periods (e.g., for loan applications) where documents can be viewed but not signed until a timer expires.
• Online Forms: Convert paper processes into digital forms where metadata is extracted automatically upon signing.
• Organization Seal: Apply your organization's digital seal to guarantee document integrity without a personal signature.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[SIGNING METHODS SECTION]
Flexible Authentication Options for Every Use Case
We understand that an internal HR memo requires different security than a million-euro mortgage contract. Allekirjoitus.fi allows you to configure the authentication level per transaction.
🛡️ Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) – The Standard
Compliant with EU eIDAS Regulation Article 26 The default standard for legally binding business agreements. Signatories are reliably identified using strong electronic identification methods.
• Methods: Finnish Mobile ID, Bank ID, Smart-ID, and other Nordic/Baltic eID solutions.
• Best for: Commercial contracts, employment agreements, public sector transactions.
⚡ Light Identification Signing (SES) – The Flexible Alternative
Simple Electronic Signature for Lower Assurance Needs When strong authentication is not necessary or available, use agile verification methods without sacrificing the audit trail.
• SMS OTP: Verify signer identity via a One-Time Password sent to their mobile phone.
• Email OTP: Verification via email code.
• Drawn Signature (InkSign): Capture a visual signature on touch devices.
• Best for: Delivery confirmations, internal approvals, low-risk B2C forms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[PRICING MODEL SECTION]
Transparent Enterprise Pricing
No hidden seat licenses. Pay for the platform and your usage.
The Enterprise Model Structure:
1. Fixed Monthly Base Fee: Covers platform access, API availability, and SSO infrastructure.
2. Transaction-Based Billing:
    ◦ Signature Request (Strong): Per signatory/transaction using BankID/MobileID.
    ◦ Signature Request (Light): Reduced rate for SMS/Email OTP signatures.
    ◦ SMS Services: Billed per message sent (e.g., for OTPs or notifications).
3. Professional Services: Hourly options for custom integration support, form creation, and bespoke development.
Note: A Signature Request is charged when a document is dispatched to a signatory, regardless of completion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[TECHNICAL SPECS & COMPLIANCE]
• Legal Compliance: Meets requirements for Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) under EU eIDAS regulations.
• Document Format: Input PDF/A; Output PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signature) containing the signature, seal, and XML audit trail.
• Verification: Signed documents are self-contained and can be verified offline using standard software like Adobe Reader.
• Data Protection: We act as the Data Processor acting on your behalf as the Data Controller, ensuring GDPR compliance regarding personal data (HETU) handling.

The page still must add the simple packages as well you cant neglect them tottaly, I didnt say get rid of them!

Based on your directive to retain the "Simple" packages while updating the content with the 2026 Price List and Service Terms, I have designed a specific "Plans & Pricing" section.

The site visitors dont give a flieng fucks about the "comparison to Portal" - wth is this relevant, they dont know the context - its was only relevant for us internally not externally!!!!!

Point taken. You are right—external visitors do not care about internal product distinctions or "Portal vs. Enterprise" comparisons; they care about solving their specific business problems. Framing the Enterprise value proposition as a "comparison to the basic version" weakens the message and wastes the visitor's time.
Here is the corrected, hard-hitting version. It isolates the Enterprise capabilities as a standalone, powerful infrastructure solution, while simply listing the Standard Packages at the bottom for those who just need a quick fix.

We must highlight the main thing the service does - EIDAS level Advanced Signatures with secure signing (authentication) with Finnish (+Nordic) all main E-ID-s. Why wasnt that stressed?

You are absolutely right. In focusing on the "Enterprise" functionality (APIs, SSO, Branding), the drafts drifted too far from the core product truth: that this is a strong authentication service generating legally binding Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES).
According to the technical documentation, the service's primary legal weight comes from "Strong Authentication" (Finnish Trust Network, BankIDs, etc.), which elevates the signature to eIDAS AES level automatically—a critical differentiator against "scribble on screen" competitors,,.
Here is the Revised Content Block that brings eIDAS AES and Nordic Authentication to the very top of the hierarchy.

[NEW KEY SECTION] THE TRUST STANDARD
Why Allekirjoitus.fi is Different: True Identity Verification
Most e-signing tools just capture an image of a signature. We capture proven identity. Our platform uses Strong Electronic Identification to meet the requirements for Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) under the EU eIDAS regulation,.
1. Broadest Nordic-Baltic Authentication Coverage
We support the native e-IDs your customers and employees already use. No new accounts required,.
• 🇫🇮 Finland: Finnish Bank IDs (all major banks), Mobile ID (Mobiilivarmenne), Finnish ID Card.
• 🇸🇪 Sweden: Swedish BankID, Freja eID.
• 🇳🇴 Norway: BankID, Buypass.
• 🇩🇰 Denmark: MitID.
• 🇪🇪 🇱🇻 🇱🇹 Baltics: Smart-ID, Mobile-ID.
2. Legal Certainty (eIDAS AES)
Every signature collected via our Strong Authentication channels creates an Advanced Electronic Signature.
• Tamper-Evident: The document is sealed with a digital certificate.
• Linked to Identity: The signature is uniquely linked to the signer via their banking or mobile credentials.
• Independent Verification: The validity of the signature can be verified offline in standard software like Adobe Reader—you are not locked into our platform to prove a contract is valid,.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[UPDATED] SIGNING METHODS & SECURITY LEVELS
Configure the required security level per transaction.
✅ Advanced Electronic Signature (AES) – The Standard Default for High-Value & Regulated Contracts Utilizes strong electronic authentication to undeniably identify the signatory.
• Compliance: EU eIDAS Article 26.
• Identity Data: Captures verified name and Personal Identity Code (HETU) in the audit trail,.
• Use Cases: Commercial contracts, employment agreements, public sector decisions, loan applications.
⚡ Simple Electronic Signature (SES) – Flexible Option For Lower-Risk Scenarios When speed is priority or strong ID is unavailable.
• Methods: SMS One-Time-Password (OTP), Email OTP, or touchscreen drawing (InkSign),.
• Use Cases: Delivery acknowledgments, internal memos, B2C forms.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[RETAINED] ENTERPRISE INFRASTRUCTURE
Built to scale strong authentication across your organization.

This version strictly prioritizes the Finnish market, highlights Strong Authentication (AES) as the core trust factor, and diversifies the client references as requested (including Keyloop). It groups the "Simple" portal packages at the bottom as a self-service option, keeping the main focus on the Enterprise Platform.

I am also using another AI to do the best version of the copy - I am providing him the 2 documents  I shared recently.


It must communicate the general needed direction (meaning changing our current landing page which was more meant as an transitional page to true product/service page and stressing, communicating, the features, sections, copy, etc  -we have stressed and agreed here. With this master prompt you are going to make the AI can build its own best version of the copy


And NB! Exclude "Espoo" but include other references.  With this prompt other AI receives full guidance how to build copy (but also the underlying layout style) for the updated page!

Here is the Master Prompt you can feed to the other AI.
This prompt synthesizes the 2026 Price List, the Service Terms, and our entire strategic conversation into a single directive. It gives the AI the context, the tone, the specific data points, and the structural constraints needed to generate the high-quality copy we developed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COPY/PASTE THIS PROMPT:
Role: You are a specialized B2B Conversion Copywriter and Web Designer. You are rebranding a service previously known as "Telia Sign" to Allekirjoitus.fi.
The Goal: Rewrite the current landing page (www.allekirjoitus.fi). The current page is a temporary "transition" page. The new copy must be a full-fledged Product/Service page. Strategic Pivot: We are moving away from selling small, standardized "Portal Packages" (SMB focus) and aggressively targeting Enterprise Clients (API integration, High Volume, Custom Workflows).
Context & Source Material: Use the attached/provided Price List 2026 and Service Terms to ensure factual accuracy regarding pricing, legal roles (Controller vs. Processor), and technical specs (PAdES, PDF/A).
Tone: Professional, Trustworthy, Nordic-Enterprise, Secure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY PAGE STRUCTURE & CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Hero Section (Value Proposition)
• Headline: Must focus on Legally Binding Advanced Electronic Signatures (AES) verified by the Finnish Trust Network (Bank IDs/Mobile ID).
• Sub-headline: Highlight that this is an infrastructure-grade solution: Secure, Scalable, API-first, and compliant with EU eIDAS.
• Primary Call to Action: "Request Enterprise Solution" (or similar).
2. Social Proof (Logos)
• Use the heading: "Trusted by Finland's Market Leaders."
• List these specific clients: Fennia, LähiTapiola, Aktia, Kuntarahoitus, KPMG, YIT, Keyloop, Aalto University.
• CONSTRAINT: Do NOT mention "City of Espoo."
3. Enterprise Platform Features (The Core Focus)
• Do not frame this as a comparison to the "basic" version. Present these as the core capabilities of the platform.
• System-to-System Automation: Highlight the REST API and Webhooks for connecting to ERP/CRM/HR systems. Mention Document Templating (sending JSON data to generate PDFs).
• Identity & Access: Highlight Single Sign-On (SSO) via Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) and hierarchical user management (Departments/Groups).
• Total Brand Ownership: Explain that Enterprise clients get Custom Domains (e.g., signing.company.fi) and full White-Labeling (removing our branding from the UI and emails).
• Advanced Data Collection: Highlight Online Forms (converting PDFs to web forms) and Open Links (public "Apply Now" style links).
4. Signing Methods (Flexibility)
• Clearly distinguish between the two security levels found in the Service Terms:
    ◦ Advanced Electronic Signature (AES): The default standard. Uses Strong Authentication (Finnish Bank IDs, Mobile ID). Used for high-value contracts.
    ◦ Simple Electronic Signature (SES): The flexible option. Uses SMS/Email OTP or Touchscreen Drawing (InkSign). Used for lower-risk/internal processes.

    ◦ Structure: Monthly Platform Fee (€275) + Transaction-based billing (Pay-as-you-go).
    ◦ Mention "Unlimited Users" and "API Access" included in the base fee.
• Self-Service/Portal (De-emphasized): Include the standardized packages (S/M/L) at the bottom or in a smaller comparison table for smaller teams.
    ◦ S Package: €15/mo (10 signatures).
    ◦ M Package: €45/mo (35 signatures).
    ◦ L Package: €85/mo (80 signatures).
6. Technical & Legal Assurance (The "Trust" Block)
• Compliance: Explicitly mention EU eIDAS Regulation.
• Data Protection: Clearly state that the Customer is the Data Controller and we are the Data Processor (GDPR).
• Format: Documents are PDF/A (input) and PAdES (output) for long-term validity.
• Offline Validation: Emphasize that signatures can be verified independently in Adobe Reader (no vendor lock-in).
Layout Instruction: Format the output using Markdown headers (H1, H2, H3) to simulate the visual hierarchy of a landing page. Use bullet points for feature lists to ensure readability.
